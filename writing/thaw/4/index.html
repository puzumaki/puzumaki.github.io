      <h1>Chapter 4: Descent</h1>

      <p>Elanai'i walked slowly down the steep mountainside, taking care to adjust her breathing to the denser air. Though no one in her lifetime had descended the mountain, she had been told it could take three days' time and enormous willpower to breathe the farther below the clouds she went. It was near the end of her first day when in the distance she could make out the edge of green bushes. Greenery was not ubiquitous above the clouds, so Elanai'i took the moment to stop for the night and take in the changing landscape.</p>

      <p>The next day was much the same. She used the staff several times to aid her down the steep cliffs, which became fewer the farther she went. What she originally thought were bushes grew bigger and bigger, until the rocky slopes melted away into softer grassy knolls and immense trees sprouted around her. Looking down, she saw the trees thicken into a wall of shadows. A forest lay at the base of the mountain, its edges creeping up the slope in a centuries long crawl.  She turned around to look at the mountain, and saw just how vast the mountain itself was. Her peak, amongst others, stood tallest and most ominous from below.</p>
        
      <p>As the sun began to set, Elanai'i happened upon a thin trickling stream. After refilling her canteen, she followed it into the forest. She ate some of her dried meat and wrapped the cloak around her. Its blue no longer camouflaged her into the general surroundings, but she was able to find a stray setting of large stones nearby. Animals were more prevalent in the forest, so she took extra precaution to keep her chakram ready and one eye open.</p>
        
      <p>It wasn't until the end of the third day she would use it. Elanai’i rose just before dawn and ate the dwindling reserves in her pouch. She had been observing the forest animals and determined a small rabbit would suffice for her next meal. Sunlight splattered the dense forest floor, and the slope finally began to flatten. Perching atop boulder, she used her cloak to blend in, hiding her presence by clearing her mind and slowing her breathing. Her hawkish eyesight swept the sparse forest floor for movement, chakram held at the ready.</p>
        
      <p>The forest life began its buzzing once more, and in the distance some forest brush twitched excitedly. Without thought, the chakram flew from Elanai’i’s hand, whistling through the air between the white and brown trunks. She heard scurrying and the sound of impact. On feather-light foot, she swung around towards it, cloak catching on the underbrush as she dashed forward. The cut was clean, the creature’s life expelled. Back at the stream near the boulder, she bathed and dressed the animal, removing a small flint and stone to start a small fire. She worked quickly to avoid the smoke becoming a beacon to unwanted visitors.</p>
        
      <hr />
        
      <p>Darc moved swiftly through the forest northward, towards the hunting cabin Garigon’s soldier had divulged to him. If the runaway princess turned towards the heart of the forest for protection, he knew she was in more trouble than she realized. Certainly she is aware of the haunted forest. People who do venture or lose their way near the haunted forest never return or are found in terrible states. Because the soldiers were as yet not able to locate her, Darc was convinced she was heading towards a worse fate than playing pawn in a game of political chess. He was quite familiar with the dealings of the haunted forest.</p>
        
      <p>It was nearing midday when he sensed something unfamiliar to the forest not far from his position. He hesitated, deciding whether to investigate or continue north. Suddenly, he heard what sounded like the air singing and a small thud in the distance. He was certain he would have heard soldiers plowing noisily through the underbrush if they caught up with their quarry.  Surely it isn't the missing royal? Listening more intently, he heard faint sounds of breaking branches and decided on a closer inspection.</p>
        
      <p>He climbed into the treetops and quietly maneuvered his way among them. Once he came upon a stream, he slowed his movements, being cautious not to reveal his existence. He found a solid yet hidden location on a low bough at the edge of the sparser wooded area.  Surveying the area for several minutes, he caught a slight movement near a boulder. A waft of smoke escaped the top of the rock, and shortly after the smell of cooked meat met Darc's nose. A figure walked from behind the boulder and bent over the stream, giving Darc his first full view, which wasn't much. Clad in an unfamiliar style, a dark blue cloak with thick hood pulled over the face. From the description of the situation at the lodge and the careful movements made by this individual, he was certain it was not the soldier's charge. Most people do not wander into the forest willingly, especially alone. Could it be Garigon sent in an unknown scout? An assassin?</p>
        
      <p>Darc tensed at that thought and reached for the hilt of his sword. At nearly the same time, the hooded figure stood up erect and moved into a defensive stance, hand on something hidden beneath the full length cloak. The air grew so heavy that the tension could nearly be cut with a knife. Surely this cloaked figure did not sense him. But as he stood and listened for any other sounds betraying any other possible disturbance, Darc was assured it was his own presence the figure was aware of. It unnerved him this assassin could easily sense his presence and made him uncertain of facing such a foe.</p>
        
      <p>They both stood unmoving for several minutes, the smell of cooking meat wafting in the light breeze that ruffled the leaves. Darc knew he had the advantage. The assassin did not appear to know his location, and he had the higher land and protection of the trees. He could take down the assassin now and catch the imperiled runaway, or he could make a quiet yet hasty retreat and continue his search knowing he was racing a seemingly formidable enemy.</p>
        
      <p>Darc narrowed his eyes and made a move forward, seeking a lower branch and sliding his sword from its hilt, the steel hissing against the scabbard. Then he heard another whistling. His foe had turned in his direction with arm extended. The whistling grew louder as something entered his peripheral vision. Instinct kicked in as he dropped his sword back in his scabbard and pulled his head back as a bright flash buzzed by his head. Balancing himself once more on the branch he saw the figure holding a clear disk in the outstretched arm.</p>
        
      <p><em>Okay, let's go to plan B instead.</em> He told himself and eased back into the trees and leaves, guard up as he made his retreat. He would have to set some traps to slow his opponent down. Luck was with him, for the assassin did not seem interested in pursuit. He turned back in the direction of the hunting lodge, racking his brain for an answer to what trickery he had just partaken. As he pondered, he paused at key spots to activate traps he already had laid out for previous jobs. If the assassin was indeed seeking the same charge, he was determined to find her first.</p>
