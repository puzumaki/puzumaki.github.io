        <pre>
Don't fall asleep little girl
It's Time to follow the White Rabbit
Into the Land of Dreams you go
Down into the Rabbit hole

Things aren't always as they seem
Do not seem always as they be
For what you desire is so uncertain
Uncertain is that to be desired

Hush little girl, don't say a word
It's all just a dream, let us go
Deep inside your head are we
All part of a mere phantasy

Listen to the walrus, listen to the carpenter
The ending's always the same as a follower
'Round and 'round we go
Deep inside the Rabbit hole

Doesn't matter if you're red or black
The Queen she's always watching her back
Suspicions lie in every corner
When you're from the royal order

So hush little girl, don't say a word
It's all just a dream, let us go
Deep inside your head are we
Simply a mere phantasy

Day is calling
Can you feel its sway
Telling you it's Time
To take the White Rabbit away

You're fine on your own, dear
Like Cheshire we'll disappear
At the afternoon's light
A little girl's delight

So hush little girl, don't say a word
It's all just a dream, let us go
Deep inside your head are we
All part of a mere phantasy</pre>
