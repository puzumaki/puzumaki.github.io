      <h1>Rome, Italy (May 2012)</h1>
			<p>Our flight out of Frankfurt was delayed for a half an hour, and upon landing in Rome we found out potentially why when we heard a crazy noise repeatedly coming from the landing gear. After a sporty van ride through some crazy Roman traffic, picking up the keys to our apartment, and picking up some lunch, we went our separate ways for the rest of the day. Herr and I went northeast to the Borghese park and rented a riscio (two person quadracycle with electric assist). Our goal was to see the <a href="http://www.galleriaborghese.it/borghese/en/edefault.htm" title="External link.">Galleria Borghese</a>, but it was sold out until Monday. So instead we cruised around the gardens. The pedal carriage was a lot of fun!</p>
				
			<p>We made a quick stop by the Hard Rock Cafe, which was only a block from the <a href="http://www.cappucciniviaveneto.it/jml/" title="External link.">Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini</a> church that houses the Capuchin Crypt. The crypt was interesting enough with only a euro donation, but no pictures makes for sad tourists. The crypts are decorated with a wide variety of human bones, unlike the Paris Catacombs that display mostly femurs and crania. It makes me all the more curious to see the <a href="http://www.ossuary.eu/index.php/en/" title="External link.">bone church in the Czech Republic</a>.</p>

			<p>The church isn't far from Trevi Fountain, but we just jumped the metro to the <a href="http://www.rome.info/roman-forum/" title="External link.">Roman Forums</a> instead. We heard later from Herr's parents that Trevi was intensely busy, so I'm a bit glad we didn't go by, even if it has one of the best gelato shops. At the forum, we sat down and enjoyed the atmosphere much more than last time (three years ago). We had spent most of our time on Palatine Hill then, so we skipped that and hung out among the ruins. It was great to take it easy, and it allowed us to appreciate it much more.</p>

			<p>We left a little after 6 p.m. and grabbed some sandwiches from a street vendor (overpriced, but it is a tourist-y area). As we ate, we watched other tourists around the Colosseum, which was entertaining enough. By then, though, we were quite exhausted with the early wake up (3:30 a.m.) and made our way back for an early night.</p>
