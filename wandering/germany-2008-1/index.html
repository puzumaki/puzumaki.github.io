      <h1>Moselle Valley, Germany (September 2008)</h1>
      <p>A month ago we went to the Moselle valley area that could aptly be called the "valley of the castles". According to our booklet, there are 18 castles including intact castles and ruins between the cities of Koblenz and Trier. As the photos reveal, the weather was drizzly and foggy, but it was still a great trip.</p>

      <p>Our first stop was the Cochem Imperial Castle in Cochem. It sat above the town so the walk was difficult (especially in heels). We took a tour of this castle, and I would have to say is one of my favorites. It even has a haunting of a previous lady brutally murdered. Creepy!</p>

      <p>Our next stop was Pyrmont Castle. This was self-guided, and there was a wedding taking place while were looked around. It was comfy and smaller, nestled farther away from civilization. We walked up to the top of the tower for a great view of the foggy hillsides.</p>

      <p>Eltz Castle was next. Eltz is unique in that it sits at the bottom of a valley and is still owned by the original family. The castle is formed of three different houses and is truly a must see castle. No indoor pictures allowed though. After the tour we checked out the treasury (it was okay, but the Residenz Palace in Munich was better).</p>

      <p>We made one last stop at Thurant Castle on our way back. Thurant was half in ruins and consisted of two separate towers that merged. The view from this castle was the best; by that time of day the fog had lifted and the sun shone on the valley and river.</p>
