      <h1>Japan 2007: travel to Tokyo</h1>
      <p>We drove to Kansas City International airport as the sun was rising. The flight to Detroit on Sunday was peaceful; we had some lunch at the online caf√© before boarding our other Northwest flight right into Tokyo-Narita airport. The airplane food upset my stomach again, so I did not get much sleep. Herr was sandwiched in the middle so also did not sleep much.</p>

      <p>We watched The Prestige and Flushed Away, but I tried sleeping during the Man of the Year. Instead, we watched some of Memoirs of a Geisha on the laptop. The airport was eerily empty when we arrived in Tokyo, we both expected it to be crowded by international flights. We went through customs easily, asked information how to get to the hotel, and ended up purchasing bus limousine tickets that stopped at the Shinagawa Prince Hotel for 3,000 yen a person. The ride was much longer than we anticipated, taking us an hour and a half.</p>
      <p>The bus drove through a great deal of Tokyo, so we were able to see some things such as Tokyo harbor. It was dark when we arrived, and we were both nodding off. We were directed to the executive hotel towers, and given a small room on the seventeenth floor.</p>
      <p>We then went and explored the hotel looking for food. They had a food court, but my stomach was still sore. Saw the vending machines that are frequent in anime. Eventually we just went to a convenience shop in the hotel and bought two rice balls and some water. They were tasty and just the right amount. We were both exhausted, so went to bed. The toilet has bidet options that kind of freaked me out. Herr enjoyed it though!</p>
