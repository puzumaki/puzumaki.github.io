      <h1>Schwetzingen, Germany (July 2009)</h1>
      <p>Schwetzingen is approximately thirty minutes away from Heidelberg and is best known for its spargel (asparagus), especially weisse spargel (white asparagas). Our friends were leaving in a week (June), and none of us had made it to the palace at Schwetzingen, so we took the opportunity to go together.  It also happened to be during spargel season.</p>

      <p>Schwetzingen is an interesting reproduction of Versailles. We did not walk through the building itself &mdash; it was a rather humorous hodgepodge of eras stitched into one &mdash; but we spent many hours walking the gardens. Ken was quite pregnant, so we took our time. It was perfect weather for the leisurely walk, and there was quite a lot to see. We came across a mosque in the southern gardens with a beautiful pond behind it and a wedding taking place.</p>

      <p>We took lunch at a cafe built into a beautiful carriage house (or guest suite wing, we couldn't figure it out), and I had spargelcremesuppe (asparagas cream suppe), made with the white asparagas. It was delicious! I don't know if I really like white asparagas any other way though. Great with bread.</p>
      <p>It is really worth the visit, especially during spargel season.</p>
