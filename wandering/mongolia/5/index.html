      <h1>Mongolia: Ulaanbaatar (Metropolitan Central Library and Children's Palace)</h1>
      <p>Cell phones are extremely popular. I can’t help but notice the myriad of unique ring tones, not one has been the same yet. Communication in general is very important with the wireless phone “holders” located every thirty or so feet apart. During all of our meetings they ring but are typically ignored.</p>

      <p>The Metropolitan Central Library of UB was our major stop today. Many foreign countries have provided many funds and resources, the most recent at MCL coming from the US Embassy to build an American Culture Room with very cutting edge technology. Apparently impressions of America from the socialist era still remain, so we are hoping to educate them better. The automation technology is quite advanced with biometric identification methods instead of library cards. The book collections did feel small though.</p>

      <p>The Children’s Palace was very interesting with reading rooms for different ages and languages. Most of the foreign language materials were donated by those countries. Speaking to the larger group of librarians and directors was insightful in learning where their interests lie according to questions they asked us. Unfortunately lack of time prohibited any real discussion as translating took a long time. We are all extremely grateful for Sayanaa’s wonderful skills. We will definitely have to find a great gift for her.</p>
