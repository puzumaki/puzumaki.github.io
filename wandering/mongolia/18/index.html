      <h1>Mongolia: Ulaanbaatar (US Embassy and National Information Technology Park)</h1>
      <p>Back to meetings for our last week, we visited the US Embassy first. This embassy is one of America’s smallest with one director and one officer both of whom we’ve had the pleasure of speaking with. Not much money flows through the embassy, so no new programs have been initiated.</p>
      <p>We did see several photos that commemorated the 70th anniversary of the first American to come to Mongolia. Apparently in 1921, Roy Chapman Andrews of Wisconsin made a number of archaeological trips whereupon he discovered dinosaur eggs. This changed the entire perspective on how dinosaurs were born. Andrews is also the historical figure Spielberg based his Indiana Jones character on. I will have to look into this more when I return.</p>
      <p>After a break we visited the National Information Technology Park once again. This time we spoke with its director, an interesting fellow who has very strong opinions on gender roles, then with Helen’s father who is also head of the MIDAS/MONITA NGO. This organization prioritizes increase in technology use with local, and soon national, businesses. We of course made our way to Ariunaa, who gave us a brief lecture on the ICT development in Mongolia, as well as her sister Sayanaa.</p>
      <p>From what we heard today, the people have very high plans to make Mongolia one of the top ten technological countries in the next decade. A high goal for the little infrastructure available. Already most aimegs are being wired with fiber optics though, so it may be possible.</p>
