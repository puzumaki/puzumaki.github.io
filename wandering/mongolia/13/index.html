      <h1>Mongolia: Dalanzadgad</h1>
      <p>The librarians gave us a tour of their library today. The air in Dalanzadgad is unusually sweet and warm, as if someone had turned the breeze into a pastry freshly cooked and inviting. Their library was very friendly as the aimag libraries seem to be with its typically Russian layout of reading rooms with closed stacks.</p>

      <p>Slightly different in that many more books were available out on display. The library Internet Center was nonfunctional, the cost too overbearing nearly the entire library budget just for Internet. They are slowly developing their technology access, baby steps.</p>

      <p>We visited our normal routine with the private television/radio station established last year, then briefly sat at the other Internet Center paired with the local post office. Heading out into the Gobi was a lot rockier than I imagines. Dust storms still rolled around us, and I was reminded of the Steppes except more desolate with its browns and greys.</p>

      <p>Our ger camp is a lot more luxurious this time with electricity in the ger, a restaurant and shop, and flushing toilets with individual shower rooms. I did enjoy the first ger camp and its complete disregard of modern novelties though, it felt freeing. This is also nice in its own ways, I am glad I have the opportunity to experience both.</p>
