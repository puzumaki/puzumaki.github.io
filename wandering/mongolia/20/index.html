      <h1>Mongolia: Ulaanbaatar</h1>
      <p>Following yesterday’s heavy winds came today’s cold and rainy weather. We toured one of the oldest radio and television broadcast system stations today, even walked out into the largest broadcasting room they had. Visiting parts of the radio station we ran into a very popular hip hop artist, so it made sense why it was difficult to get through the building entrance.</p>

      <p>On the way out the lobby was busy with Mongolian Idol contestants, so the station is popular both in the competitive city and the coutryside nationwide. A few hours of free time spent at the Internet Café and some shopping, then the Cultural Concert that held many foreigners. I did not know it was simply a tourist attraction, but it was enjoyable to see traditional dances and hear Mongolia’s traditional music.</p>
      <p>Afterwards we met up with our people including Bayaraa, Sayanaa, Ariunaa, and Helen to eat dinner together. The ride was forty five minutes to the outskirts of the city to eat at Chingghis Palace, a ger camp containing memorabilia from the Chingghis Khan movie. They had horses and camels to ride at a price, but it was too cold to enjoy so I instead shot a few arrows, quite poorly I might add. The food was delicious and company very good.</p>

      <p>At the end we exchanged gifts and expressed how much we enjoyed having met each other with wishes to continue lines of communication strong. They truly are wonderful people, I will miss Sayanaa the most. I do wish them all the best of luck, but I am also glad to be going home, back to the familiar, once again.</p>
