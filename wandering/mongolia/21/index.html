      <h1>Mongolia: Ulaanbaatar</h1>
      <p>Our last actual day in Mongolia was spent walking around the city lazily, looking for the last few items on our lists. We had an adventure finding the musical instrument shop, but a very nice man at the Union of Mongolian Artists was able to interpret my poor Mongolian language skills and draw a very precise map to the actual production shop. The actual moorin khuur was quite expensive being of the professional lot, but I was able to purchase a hard case fairly cheap. The actual moorin khuur was not much more as I opted for a less professional model only slightly more than the case itself cost.</p>
      <p>Otherwise we spent much of the day cleaning and sitting at the Silk Road and Brauhaus. Enjoying the weather, the atmosphere, relaxing and taking our time. I really love the building the Silk Road is in, and if ever I have my own restaurant I wish to use it as a model.</p>

      <p>Getting to the airport was also an adventure for as we were about to enter the elevator, it broke with several people crammed inside. Thus we were forced to walk down the darkened stairwells, all eight flights, with our luggage. A feat, to say the least. I will bring back with me very memorable moments, both good and bad as life tends to balance itself. Hopefully only good ones will leave a lasting impression for my first trip beyond American borders.</p>
