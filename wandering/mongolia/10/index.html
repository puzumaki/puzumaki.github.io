      <h1>Mongolia: Tsetserleg to Ulaanbaatar</h1>
      <p>The drive back from Tsetserleg was rather uneventful, and it was quite painful on my back that is still recovering. An overcast day, seeing the clouds ring or drown out the mountains completely is a sight to stare at. The eight hour trip back to Ulaanbaatar was quite dreary with sprinkles near our destination.</p>
      <p>Being back in Ulaanbaatar has its blessings and curses. Access to constantly running water, and hot water even, Internet Centers with fast connections everywhere, banks to finally have money again, and many shops to wander into. The traffic is horribly scary with its loud honking a constant stain on the ear drums, the pollution and smell of rotting garbage and human refuse heady in the air and buildings, and poverty spilling out of the sewers bountifully.</p>
      <p>We did not miss our mischevious little orphan, and he even brought a friend this time. I do feel bad for them, and the others make sure to give them food and money. I cannot soundly give them “gifts” as freely, I feel bad for it as well. Today, however, proved a good reason why it is not the best idea as even after we gave them food we were followed until we hailed a taxi simply so he was unable to follow us back to our apartment.</p>
      <p>The cab driver was extremely jovial seeming to understand our predicament and providing us with some of that wonderful Mongolian friendliness. I feel so much better finally getting a nice hot shower, relish in simple luxuries such as this before we head to the desert.</p>
