      <h1>Mongolia: Khar Khorin (Erdene Zuu)</h1>
      <p>It feels as if we are so close to the sky that I can just reach up and touch the clouds. This may be because our ger camp and Khar Khorin are located in the Altai Mountains nearly half a mile about sea level. The mountains looked painted onto the horizon, the flat tans and greens of the Steppe sprawling out before them sprinkled with white, brown, and black spots that are sheep, goats, cows, and horses.</p>

      <p>Erdene Zuu was built over the ancient Khar Khorin site with modern Khar Khorin next to it. Inside the 108 stupa wall were several temples as well as archaeological artifacts from the ancient city. Buddhism was very dominant before the socialist era and is again becoming popular. The older temple buildings in all their color were turned into a museum, then we had a lama gray for us safe journeys and good fortune.</p>

      <p>Afterwards we met with the school librarians and heard a lecture from the director about the literature and culture of Mongolia during the socialist era. We also stopped at the black market and university. The entire city seems rather run down, although it is supposedly the second largest city with around five thousand people. It was a blessing to be back at the ger camp, the lifestyle is so simple and friendly.</p>
