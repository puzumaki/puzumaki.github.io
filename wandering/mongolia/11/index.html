      <h1>Mongolia: Ulaanbaatar (Gandean Monastery and Cultural Institute)</h1>
      <p>Another full day with mostly cloudy rainy weather. We started by going to Ulaanbaatar’s Gandean Monastery to meet the famous lama Purevbat. Inside on temple grounds everything felt peaceful despite the confusion on where we ought to be. The pigeons were a sight to see, moving in such coherent motion as if a wave rollicking a boat gently then finding ground again. I enjoyed most when a swarm would rise from one of the old temple buildings as if rising spirits or prayers.</p>

      <p>Meeting the lama was an experience I shall not forget. He seemed a very friendly man with many tasks that do not seem to stress him, and surrounded by people seeking his insight. Indeed he did sound knowledgeable and proud of his heritage and Mongolian traditions. He spoke fondly of their inherent gift to coexist with nature as the nomadic way of life is still in the heart of all. I was moved by his stories and enjoyed his recounting of the history of Buddhism and its tie to the people.</p>
      <p>We next visited the Cultural Institute to speak with the director and a few of our Mongolian counterparts. The education system at the Cultural Institute is not too different from America, requiring one hundred twenty credits for a bachelors and another thirty credits for a masters degree. The library program does require passing two exams as well. After a fairly miserable Korean lunch, we met with Ariunaa for a brief introduction to the situation between main Ulaanbaatar and its suburbs that consist primarily of the ger district.</p>
      <p>Going to the cultural center in the ger district was a sight as a bus appeared to have broken down in the middle of the street with dozens of people standing around it, traffic upset with the mess. In the district roads were all dirt, reminding me a little of the “save the children” commercials on television. Not that bad, but reminiscent.</p>
      <p>Many children were at the center, the library was in a small back room the children had to sit in to read. I was surprised to hear World Vision had donated all the books it owned, and in Mongolian no less. We also took a side trip to the newer section of town, very nice condominiums with many more luxuries. This was on the way to a monument residing atop a hill overlooking the city, donated by the Russians to commemorate their friendship. The view, after a winded stair climb, was worth seeing. Cities, from a distance, seem much more peaceful.</p>
