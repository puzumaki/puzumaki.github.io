        <h3>Tuning</h3>
        <p><strong>Electronic $100, Aural $150</strong></p>
        <h4>Seasonal discount</h4>
        <p>Minnesota&#39;s four distinct seasons are hard on pianos, and the best way to keep them in proper tune as the humidity and temperatures shift is to have it tuned every 3 months. Therefore, I offer a cumulative discount for each subsequent tuning within a year of the first. Those who continue to have their piano tuned every 3 months will be charged the 4<sup>th</sup> tuning rate.</p>

        <h3>Hammer reshaping</h3>
        <p><strong>$100</strong</p>
        <p>If your piano has been played for many years without any maintenance on the hammers, the heads get compacted and flattened where they strike the strings. Deep grooves at the strike points can dramatically alter the piano&#39;s tone. Reshaping will restore the attack and reduce stress on the hammer shanks, especially on grands, where the mute pedal shifts the hammers to one side and the grooves in the felt can subject the shanks to undue stress.</p>

        <h3>Basic regulation</h3>
        <p><strong>$150</strong></p>
        <p>As hammers get compacted through use, especially in the middle of the keyboard where the keys get played the most, the hammers wind up traveling farther to hit the string, altering touch and reducing responsiveness, especially when playing softly. Adjusting the let-off and drop will make your piano easier to play through a wider dynamic range, making the experience of playing your piano more rewarding, like driving an older car with new suspension and tires.</p>

        <h3>Voicing</h3>
        <p><strong>$150</strong></p>
        <p>All pianos get brighter the more they get played. Every keystroke makes the hammer felts harder, making the tone brighter. Voicing the hammers back down restores a softer attack when played gently, while still allowing a brighter attack when played hard. Expand your piano&#39;s expressive possibilities by having it voiced. This applies to new pianos too. Most American builders ship their pianos with hard hammers, as it&#39;s easier for a technician to voice it down in the field.</p>

      <h2>Why HiLu</h2>
      <p>HiLu was my great grandmother&#39;s nickname, whose actual name was Lucille Gilbert. She was a talented pianist who gave up a concert career to raise my grandfather and his older sister. Her husband was surprised to find out after the wedding that she had a $900 (in 1920s dollars) debt for a Mason and Hamlin piano she had recently bought.</p>
      <p>She taught two generations of piano students on that instrument. With the permission of her descendents, including the one who coined her nickname, I have named my business in honor of the best pianist in my family. My goal is to make every piano I tune enjoyable for HiLu to play.</p>
