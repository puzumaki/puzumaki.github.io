      <h2>We are diverse thinkers</h2>
      <p>We need not think alike to love alike. We are people of many beliefs and backgrounds: people with a religious background, people with none, people who believe in a God, people who donâ€™t, and people who just let the mystery be. We seek to welcome you just as you are: your whole self, with all your truths and your doubts, your fears and your hopes.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="block-3">
      <h2>We act for justice</h2>
      <p>We have a legacy of &ldquo;deeds not creeds.&rdquo; Our work for a better world calls us to harness love&rsquo;s power to stop oppression. From grassroots community organizing to state, national, and corporate advocacy; in protest marches, prayer vigils, and press conferences; in homeless shelters and in prisons, we are called to put our faith into action.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="block-4">
      <h2>We support each other</h2>
      <p>From infancy to old age, we support each other&rsquo;s paths as we seek to live lives of  integrity, compassion, commitment, and joy.  We help each other learn and grow as we explore our faiths, our identities, and our world.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="block-5">
      <h2>We serve</h2>
      <p>Service is at the core of our faith. We are called to make a positive difference in the world. We partner with, and advocate for, people and organizations in need of support. We live our values out loud.</p>
