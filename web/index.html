        <h2>Web manifesto</h2>
        <p>The web manifesto is in practice at the <a href="https://umnlibraries.github.io/design-system/principles/">University of Minnesota Libraries' design system</a>.</p>
        <h3>Universally accessible</h3>
        <p>Deliver content and services where barriers to access are removed for all people to use regardless of technology, format, or methods of delivery.</p>
        <p>Avoid building to one way of doing or being. Build to be understandable, in a way that allows us to be human and make errors.</p>

        <h3>Honest</h3>
        <p>Be transparent.</p>
        <p>Provide accurate content written with non-biased language. Clearly identify opinionated content. Fight disinformation, or the act of intentionally deceiving in content and algorithms.</p>

        <h3>Inclusive</h3>
        <p>Lead with person-first design, designing with people, not for them. Be aware of our own biases and assumptions, and recognize we are not the user.</p>
        <p>Embrace people as complex beings, where average doesn’t exist.</p>
        <p>Be aware of stereotypes and <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_ngozi_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story">single story narratives</a>. Embed diversity throughout the entire design, development, and implementation process so content and services are made for everyone (regardless of gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, ability, cultural background, and emotional state).</p>

        <h3>Mindful</h3>
        <p>Make decisions that prioritize user well-being, don’t build to steal attention, and avoid dark and anti-patterns.</p>

        <h3>Private</h3>
        <p>Promote and ensure privacy through security and personal data ownership. Provide these tenets in systems and services to the best of our ability and be transparent where we cannot.</p>

        <h3>Simple</h3>
        <p>Write simple and plain language for clear and concise messaging. Craft the most elegant semantic solution, and use available resources intentionally.</p>

        <h3>Sustainable</h3>
        <p>Factor in energy source and consumption for optimizations, from server to client side. Just as people do not deserve a reduced experience, our planet does not deserve to suffer the consequences of bad design and web delivery.</p>
        <p>Sustainability is as much about our planet’s wellbeing as it is our own, as they are intertwined.</p>
